## 📌 Project Overview
Managing global logistics is complex. The **DataCo Supply Chain Intelligence Suite** is an end-to-end Tableau dashboard designed to turn raw supply chain data into clear, actionable business insights. Instead of just tracking shipments, this tool digs into *why* certain routes succeed and where hidden bottlenecks impact profitability.

By analyzing global orders, inventory, and shipping profiles, this strategic command center helps decision-makers identify:
- **Efficiency Winners:** Which shipping modes and routes drive profit and speed.
- **Hidden Bottlenecks:** Underperforming areas causing delays or reducing margins.
- **Proactive Planning:** Anticipating future demand to keep inventory balanced and customers satisfied.

## 🚀 Key Features & Dashboards
This suite comprises five main components:

1. **End-to-End Order Fulfillment Tracking:** Monitors the lifecycle of orders to ensure timely delivery and highlight systemic delays.
2. **Profitability & Regional Heatmaps:** Visualizes which global regions, product categories, and shipping modes are the most lucrative.
3. **Inventory & Lead-Time Optimization:** Highlights discrepancies between scheduled and actual shipping days to refine inventory planning.
4. **Supply Chain Strategy & Efficiency Analysis:** Evaluates different fulfillment strategies to maximize operational ROI.
5. **Dedicated Predictive Forecasting:** Anticipates future demand and delivery risks, enabling proactive inventory and routing adjustments.

## 💡 Technical Highlight: Strategic Performance Quadrant
A core feature of this project is the **Strategic Performance Quadrant**. This visualization instantly categorizes different supply chain strategies and shipping modes into "Stars" or "Underperformers." This allows supply chain managers to quickly optimize logistics spend and improve overall delivery times at a glance.
